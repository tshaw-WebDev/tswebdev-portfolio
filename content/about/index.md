## About Me

![TSWebDev Portrait](/images/about/tswebdevportpic2.png)

My background in tech began during the Windows and Dot-Com era, based in Manchester UK, studying Advanced IT in college during the mid-90s, then Business IT and Information & Communications at university in the early 2000's.  

After a long hiatus, I returned to web development using modern tools like AI, online resources, and real-world projects to refresh and expand my skills.
